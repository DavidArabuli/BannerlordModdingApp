        <p>Using Bannerlord modding tools is extremely easy</p>
        <br />

        <p>1) Navigate to the unit you want to edit.</p>

        <br />

        <p>2) Enter desired values in a skill box (from 0 to 999)</p>
        <br />

        <p>
          3) If you wish to add or replace items - choose equipment roster (some
          units only have one roster), choose a slot appropriate to your desired
          item type, and choose new item from a dropdown menu. Proceed to
          another slot, next equipment roster or to another unit.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          4) When you are happy with your choices - click "submit and download
          XML" button.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          5) This will download an XML file, named "spnpccharacters.xml", on
          your computer.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          6) Navigate to \Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\ Modules\SandBoxCore\
          ModuleData, and replace existing "spnpccharacters.xml" file with file
          produced by this app. I suggest backing up your original file, so that
          you can revert your changes.

        <h3 class="infoTitle">Things to know:</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          - The file you get is fully compatible with original vanilla
          Bannerlord.
          <br />
          - It was not tested with mods that heavily modify your original game
          files.
          <br />
          - It should work in most scenarios, unless you have directly removed
          some of the items or units, or changed id-s that are used in
          "spnpccharacters.xml".
          <br />
          - XML structure of original file is preserved.
          <br />
          - The only side-effect is that during conversion, "comments" from the
          original file are lost, but this does not affect your game whatsoever.
          <br />
          - Item0,1,2,3 - are slots for weapons and shields.
          <br />
          - All other have self-explaining names.

        <h3 class="infoTitle">plans for the future:</h3>
        <p>
          As this purely frontend app is inherently limited by not being able to
          access file system and by some performance limitations, I will not
          update it with new features, instead I want to concentrate my efforts
          on creating a desktop modding app.
          <br />

          Desktop version will have advanced features, ability to make
          consecutive edits, modify items, party templates and some more.
