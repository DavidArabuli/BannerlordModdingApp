M&B Bannerlord modding tools

the goal is to give user ability to modify
- unit`s skill stats (like bow skill, riding etc)
- unit`s inventory (and equipped weapons and armor)

Requires:
I believe that most work on units can be done in spnpccharacters.xml 

Possible flow:
reading existing values from game xml file ->
-> creating data structure to store it -> 
-> pass data to form ->
-> render initial values and default inventories ->
-> gather data from inputs (*mb formdata API?*) ->
-> pack it for xml-js library, in a JSON form ->
-> JSON to xml conversion ->
-> download edited xml.

notes and issues so far:

14.04.2024.

Xml->JSON-xml conversion messes up comments, but 
overall it works, without major problems. Game is not crashing, and in-game values are updated successfully.

basic structure for skill modification is created, culture divs populated with appropriate unit cards, with access to skills and other unit data.

to do:
Have to filter units without skills, also filter all the tournament units, smiths etc - all non-hirable units. They are not really needed and only make code convoluted later on.
